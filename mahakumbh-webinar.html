                      <p><em>&quot;Welcome to this wonderful occasion! It is a great celebration of Mahakumbh, especially in light of its enormous contribution to world peace and planetary harmony during these turbulent times. I extend my heartfelt thanks to Prof. Girish Kumar and, of course, to our great friend and inspiration behind this entire initiative, the visionary behind the Amrithagiri Foundation, Shri Denny Amrithagiri. We have already heard about his unwavering commitment to planetary peace, how he harnesses the elements of nature, the mountains, the rivers to cultivate a deeper consciousness. Beyond that, we are also gradually discovering his dedication to social peace. So, Denny, I welcome and commend you for this wonderful initiative.<br>For me, joining this initiative was never a question; it was a calling. Not only does the UNESCO Chair for Peace deeply resonate with the ideas and work of the Amrithagiri Foundation, but I also feel a sense of belonging here. There is a light in this initiative one that offers not only spiritual bliss but also the satisfaction of fostering harmony and peace within ourselves, our communities, and the world at large. Some of the profound expressions of this mission have already been articulated beautifully by others. Thank you, Prof. Girish.<br>As we approach the conclusion of this sacred Mahakumbh, with its major events drawing to a close tomorrow, let me emphasize that peace is about people, about human connections and coexistence. Many years ago, while exploring the true meaning of peace, I encountered an enlightened soul not just a scholar but a true practitioner. He shared with me an idea beyond harmony and bliss the concept of mingling. Peace is about meeting people, engaging with them, celebrating life together with a sense of unity and joy. In this regard, Mahakumbh stands as a historical testament, one of those rare, extraordinary moments when millions gather, transcending boundaries of region, geography, and culture. It is not about counting the numbers but understanding the essence of this gathering: that despite the challenges, the hardships, and the differences in social and economic strata, people come together, undivided by religious affiliations or societal status.<br>This, indeed, is an embodiment of the great principle of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam the idea that the world is one family. It is a principle cherished not only in Indian civilization but across cultures worldwide. We see reflections of this in Ubuntu and other traditions across civilizations. The key learning from today is that peace must be felt; togetherness must be lived. We must think in terms of community, care for one another, and embrace a life dedicated to collective well-being rather than individual gains. This is the essence of Mahakumbh, and it is the lesson it imparts to all who participate.<br>As we continue with today’s discussions, let me highlight one of the major concerns of global communities and institutions, particularly peaceful institutions, not war-mongering or military-based establishments. UNESCO has long emphasized the need to cultivate a culture of peace, a way of living that embraces differences and fosters coexistence despite incompatibilities. In 2023, UNESCO concluded a decade-long celebration of cultural confluence, a French concept that resonates deeply with the symbolism of the sacred river Ganga, or the Ganges, as it is known in different parts of the world. The Triveni Sangam, the confluence of rivers, holds profound significance in our thought process.<br>Coming from Varanasi, I have witnessed firsthand how such confluences manifest in many forms not only through rivers but also through traditions and communities. The Ganga-Jamuni Tehzeeb is a testament to this, where Hindu and Muslim cultures intertwine seamlessly, exemplified by figures like Kabir Das and Ustad Bismillah Khan, who played the shehnai in the temples of Lord Shiva. This reminds us that the impact of Mahakumbh today is not an isolated event but a culmination of the ethos of our civilization, a civilization that has always prioritized communal living and unity in diversity.<br>India is loved worldwide for this very reason: our ability to honor and celebrate diversity, not just among our own people but also in welcoming those from different cultures. Mahakumbh exemplifies this spirit of togetherness not just among humans but across all planetary elements. In our tradition, Shanti (peace) is not merely the absence of war or conflict; it is about a deep union with nature, a reverence for all living and nonliving beings alike. Mahakumbh is the embodiment of this philosophy, and I hope and pray that this spirit of unity and collaboration continues to flourish.<br>We have an exceptional lineup of speakers today. Just the other day, I had a meaningful discussion with Dwivediji, who explained the profound idea behind the Samudra Manthan, the churning of the ocean by both Sur and Asur to obtain Amrit (nectar of immortality). It is a powerful metaphor: even those perceived as adversaries must work together to achieve something greater. This makes the work of the Amrithagiri Foundation all the more significant, for, in the end, we are all seekers of Amrit. While our physical existence is temporary, our souls are eternal.<br>With these thoughts, I conclude my address. I am eager to hear from my esteemed colleagues and speakers. Once again, I extend my congratulations to Prof. Girish Kumar for bringing me into this association with Denny Amrithagiri. Together, we are part of a growing network that is committed to this journey of peace, bliss, and happiness. Let us continue this mission, working collectively toward a world of harmony and enlightenment.&quot;</em></p>

                      <p><em>&quot;Mahakhumbh 2025: A journey of Peace is the title of the seminar which is being oraganised by ARF  in collaboration with the UNESCO Peace Chair, Benares Hindu University , Centre for Peace and Development , Varanasi.. I first of all extend my pranams to all the esteemed speakers especially Priyankar Upadhyayaji who introduced me  to partake of this seminar, to Dr. Ravindra Muley, respected Scholar,Dr Nishikant Borghe,Dr Sandeep Dhikale and all the scholars and the participants.<br>First of all we shall discuss the word Kumbh. Kumbh is a Sanskrit word . Here Kumbh means Prithvi.<br>sanskrit Sloka….<br>One who fulfills the entire land with prosperity and the sense of eternity is called Kumbh.This is the meaning that the word kumbh actually stands for.. We all perform poojas at our houses and the most important thing we do is the Kumbh Sthapana.Without the Kumbh Sthapana sanadhani vedic pooja is not actually complete.<br>What is the verse that is recited at the time of putting the khumbh in sanatani pooja?<br>The verse is also very important. In that verse we say<br>:Sanskrit Sloka<br>This is the verse we recite while putting the khumbh before performing any type of pooja.here we say that all the gods are actually residing in the khumbh and they bless the human being for their upliftment.not only the gods but all the mathrugan ,all the devis are also present in the khumbh and even all the oceans.</em></p>
                      <p><em>There are 3 auspicious rivers, Bhagavati Ganga, Bhagavati Yamuna and Bhagavati Saraswati; we have details about the performance of the types of Kumbhas in our tradition. Now I would like to go to the one very famous choupaayi of Tulsidasji which comes in the Baal Kaand of Ramcharitmanas.</em></p>
                      <h1><em> <br>Maagh Makar gati Ravi jab hoyee</em><br><em><br>Theerath pati sab aav sab koyee</em><br><em><br>Dev Danuj Kinnar Nar shreni</em><br><em><br>Saadar majjayi sakal Triveni</em></h1>
                      <p><em>‍<br>This is the actual source of Kumbh purity, this is the actual source at work – internal and external peace both. As Tulsidasji says ‘Dev, Daanav, Kinnar, Nar shreni’. Shreni means a number of. Thus, many Devas, Danavas, Kinnaras and humans used to come here. They take dips in the holy water of Ganga with full devotion and auspicious feeling, without any type of internal conflict, almost forgetting all types of their differences. This is the real sense of the origin of mahakumbh.<br> On Makar Sankranti, when Sun moves into the Makar Raasi, Kumbh is held at Prayagraj at Triveni, the confluence of the 3 auspicious rivers. So far as Nasik and Ujjain are concerned, when Sun moves into Sinh Raasi, Kumbh is held at Nasik. And when Sun enters Mesh Raasi, Kumbh is held at Ujjain. <br> These are the details available in the Shaastras about the performance of the Kumbh at these 4 places. Now why only at these 4 places is another question that arises. So we come to the story of Samudra Manthan (churning of the ocean), which is mentioned in the 6th Chapter of the 8th Skandham (Canto) of Srimad Bhagavat Mahaa-Puraan. <br> In this entire story of Samudra Manthan, what happened? First of all, the demons defeated the Devas, i.e. Asuras defeated Suras. How did the demons become so powerful? This question arises. It is because of Shukraachaarya, their Guru. Shukraachaarya had an unparalleled quality, power, that is Mrithasanjeevani Vidya. What does it mean? The power of making demons immortal, making them alive even after being declared dead in the war. So the demons were having an unparalleled power; therefore they overpowered the Suras. <br> In this particular situation, the Gods approached Lord Vishnu. Here, the name of the Lord is Ajeet, meaning one who cannot be conquered, cannot be overpowered by anyone. The Devas asked him how to overpower the demons. It was necessarily required to strengthen and establish the rule of Dharma, i.e. righteousness for the entire humanity, for the peace and tranquillity of the entire humanity. Lord Ajeet advised them that the only way was to do Samudra Manthan – Samudra Manthan of the Ksheer Saagar (Ocean of Milk) In order to attain Amrit (celestial nectar), what shall we do? We shall put all types of Oushadhis (medicinal herbs) available in Prithvi (Earth) in Ksheer-Saagar and churn it with the help of Mandara-achal (Mandara Mountain), with the help of Vaasuki Naag (Serpent). But t was not possible for the Asuras alone to move the mountain and reach up to the last stage, i.e. the evolution of Amrit. So God advised them that in order to accomplish this, they had to take the support of the Asuras also. The Gods were not powerful enough to make Samudra Manthan successful. Thus they essentially required the power of demons too to reach their ultimate goal of acquiring Amrit. Then Lord Vishnu tells them this very important words; and these words tell them about this tragedy that we shall follow in order to achieve our higher goal. He says:<br>‍</em></p>
                      <h1><em>अरयोऽपि हि सन्धेया: सति कार्यार्थगौरवे ।<br>अहिमूषिकवद् देवा ह्यर्थस्य पदवीं गतै: (S.B. 8.6.20)<br>Transliteration:<br>arayo ’pi hi sandheyāḥ<br>sati kāryārtha-gaurave<br>ahi-mūṣikavad devā<br>hy arthasya padavīṁ gataiḥ</em></h1>
                      <p><em>‍<br>Meaning: O demigods, fulfilling one’s own interests is so important that one may even have to make a truce with one’s enemies. For the sake of one’s self-interest, one has to act according to the logic of the snake and the mouse.<br>This is a very good example of achieving a higher goal. You will have to make sandhi (truce) with Asuras in order to achieve your goal. The Lord Ajeet gives an example, i.e. ahi-mooshakvaad – ahi means snake and mooshak means mouse. Now what is the story of the snake and the mouse – here, a mouse enters the basket of a snake. Both are actually opposite to each other; both are caught in the basket. They eagerly wanted to get out of it as early as possible. But they will fight and will not get out of it. The snake in this situation advises the mouse to make a hole big enough in the basket so that they can escape together. The mouse did so. The snake immediately swallowed the mouse and escaped alone from the basket. And this is the way the Suras will have to follow in order to achieve the Amrit and make them strong enough to fight against the demons. That is, in the Deva-Asura sangraam (war), which is expected in the near future. The same technique was to be followed by the Devas for Samudra Manthan. After the emergence of Amrit, Devas will deprive Asuras of it. Lord Vishnu who is named as Ajeet told the Devas before the beginning of Samudra Manthan that they will have to accept all the conditions, right or wrong, of the Asuras in order to achieve their goal that is the emergence of the Amrit. If they indulged in any type of fighting with the Asuras in the beginning itself, they would not achieve their ultimate goal that is Amrit. Now in Samudra Manthan, many Ratnas (gems; here, precious outcomes) emerged, and they have been mentioned in the 9th Chapter of the 8th Skandha of Srimad Bhagavata mahapuraan. First of all, vish (poison) emerged, that is Halahal (name of the poison) and Bhagavan Shiv, that is Mrityunjay, adopted it; put it in his neck and saved the entire humanity, the entire world, from its fire. From then he got the name Neelkantt. Then came the cow Kamdhenu. Kamdhenu was adopted by the Rishis because she was essentially required for the successful performance of the Yagyas. Panchagavya (milk, curds, butter, ghee and cow-dung) is necessary for successfully performing Yagyas. So Rishis accepted it. Then Uchaishrava the horse came out. Indra desired to have it, but Lord Ajeet asked him not to stick to his desire because the Rakshasa King Bali was also desirous of UchaIshrava. So they gave it to Bali. Then came Airaavat, Airaavat was taken by Indra. Then came Kaustabha mani (gem); it was taken by Lord Vishnu. Then came Kalpa-vriksh (the wishing tree); Kalpavriksh was also taken by Indra. Then vame out the Apsaras (the heavenly damsels). The Apsaras were taken by the Devas. They were not taken by the demons. Then came out Lakshmi. Lakshmi was taken by Lord Vishnu. Then came Vaaruni (sura, i.e. liquor); it was taken by the Asuras. Then Chandrama, and Sharngh Dhanush (Bow named Sharngh) – Chandrama was taken by Shiva and Sharngh Dhanush by Vishnu. Paanchjanya (name of conch) came out which was taken by Vishnu. Then, lastly, that is thirteenth, Dhanvanthari came out with the Amrit Kumbh Kalash (pot) in his hand. The symbol of Dhanvantari is indicative of good health; it can only be obtained by having internal purity and peace. <br>Three Gods - Sun, Moon and Brihaspati - protected the Amrit kalash from Asuras. The Sun and the Moon informed Mohini about Raahu and Kethu sitting between Gods for Amrit. Thus they were overpowered; they are still overpowered by Raahu and Kethu during the solar and lunar eclipse. <br>The support of Lord Vishnu is unique in the Samudra Manthan is unique in the sense that he suppressed the mountain Mandara-achal strongly, and sent it below; and in the form of Kachhap (tortoise), protected it from submerging into the ocean. He transferred his power equally between the Devas and the Asuras. He made the mountain strong enough to move the ocean round and round again and ultimately he entered into the eyes of Vaasuki Naag in the form of deep sleep.  <br>The dialogue between the Devas and the demons is unparalleled because it tells us how to conquer evils intellectually without indulging in any type of fight. Thus what comes out of this entire episode depends on unity of human beings; integrity in thoughts and actions is very much required for achieving any higher goal, moving for a single auspicious goal together without any discrimination, have no difference on the basis of caste, creed, region and religion. Thus the Kumbh Parv (festival) is the biggest social, spiritual, and cultural source of integrity in the Sanatan Dharma. Social importance is that coming together without any discrimination; its spiritual importance is that liberation from all types of ill feelings or deeds, and it is the biggest symbol of unity in diversity all around the world. It is essentially required to achieve the goal the UN Sustainable Development goal 16 which emphasises peace, justice, and strong institutions. <br>So we shall all pay attention to this story and if we go deep into the story, from the dialogue between the Devas and the Asuras and Lord Ajeet, a number of new things come out of it. This dialogue is thus very important. This is what I would like to submit, and I extend my Pranaamas (salutations) to all the organizers for giving me a chance to speak a few words in this Seminar.&quot;</em></p>

                      <p><em>&quot;The Sanskrit shloka recited in the beginning and also at many places throughout the speech can be retained as such. <br> Namaste!<br>The shloka recited after this greeting is a salutation to Goddess Saraswati and Lord Ganesh. <br>Offering my salutations to all the noble souls in the audience here, I am presenting before you my thoughts on today’s topic. Sri. Sadashivji has already spoken to you in detail about the Kumbh. It has also been elaborated here how Kumbh had originated in the distant past; its greatness has been highlighted extensively too. <br>Whatever has been mentioned in our scriptures for human welfare is definitely manifested outwardly, and is visible to us in the Mahakumbh. This fact has also been vouchsafed in this forum. <br>The festival of Kumbh is always celebrated in 4 locations – Prayagraj, Haridwar, Nasik and Ujjain, one after the other. <br>The Saanti-Mantras in the Vedas are prayers for Peace. For example, one mantra declares: ‘Peace be to Earth, Peace be to the Atmosphere; Peace be to the Sky; Peace be to Water…’  and so on and so forth. In this way, prayers for Peace have been incorporated in different places in the Vedas. This is applicable to Kumbh also.<br>Ku means earth; Kumbh means Prithvi. Kumbh is made of earth, that is, soil or mud. The importance of soil or earth has been expounded in the Upanishads. Everything is, in fact, earth. Everything is created with earth, of earth. In fact, earth is found everywhere. With earth, idols are made; ghats are formed of earth too. <br>In essence, only one Principle exists; everything else is its variation. The basis or foundation of everything is earth. Mahendra-stuti also declares that this is true. (Retain the verse.)  <br>In Marathi, Saint Tukaram has said that the influence of this thought is seen in Kumbh also. People of different natures and occupations visit Kumbh. With what thoughts they go to the Kumbh, we cannot say. Yet, mob psychology has its own role. Sadashivji has expressed this view. <br>Pandarpuri Yatra happens in Maharashtra, Jagannath Puri Yatra in Odissa. It cannot be said that all those who go to Pandarpur think alike. Yet, the devotion of all is the same. Eknathji has said the same. <br>Devotion changes our lives. Intense devotion is required to guide us forward. This is provided by pilgrimages. One of Adi Shankaracharya’s shlokas prove this. (Retain the shloka here)<br>After ‘manaspuja’, i.e. mental worship, we invariably feel purified within. Similarly, after Kumbh, we feel purified. If this does not happen, the question arises as to whether mental peace alone is the result of a dip. In our scriptures, the greatness of water has been well proclaimed. Water purifies everything. Sprinkling water on our bodies cause the formation of Goosebumps. Similar feeling is experienced here, even if the water is of a different nature. <br>A question can arise as to what importance is given to water in the Hindu religion. Significance of water is not restricted to Hindu religion alone. In the places of worship of Islam and Christianity also, water is considered sacred. Kumbh gives us the waters of sacred Ganga. Bharthruhari had said, “When will I go to Ganga in Varanasi…When will I be blessed, experience that bliss…?”<br>In temples and elsewhere, so many festivals are conducted. But Kumbh is not just a festival; it is the grandest of grand of all festivals. When we even hear about Kumbh, we get that elated feeling in our minds; our minds are raised to a state of bliss and mental tranquillity. Uplifting our minds is always essential. <br>Like how the Gita says, there are 4 types of devotees. For all of them, Kumbh is equally noble. People go to Kumbh without desiring for results, or to be exonerated of their sins. It is in addition that they attain total tranquillity of mind. On taking a dip in the Holy Ganga during Kumbh, one gets intense feelings of elation and peace. <br>Kumbh is also a symbol of our body. A pot is made of earth and gets mingled with earth in the end. Our body too is born and finally, it dies. The foetus developing in a mother’s womb can be compared to a Kumbh. It will ultimately be unified with eternity. In Yajurved also, Kumbh has been spoken of as a symbol of creation. <br>Further, whatever be a festival of Hindus, a Kumbh is always placed and worshipped in the puja place. In any new construction site also, Kumbh has its own significance.<br>On just taking the name of Ganga, one experiences a sensation of ecstasy. On taking a dip in the Ganga, one will undoubtedly be immersed in bliss. Even Sanyasis from various Akhadas visit the Kumbh, take a dip and get purified.</em></p>
                      <p><em>It is a principle of the Upanishads that if we have to achieve peace of mind, we have to do ‘thapas’ meaning austerities. There is no other way. Thapas and ‘vratas’, i.e. fasting and other related observances, are essential for the ‘jijnasus’, i.e. seekers, as well as the common people. We perform such austerities before going to Kumbh. ‘Tapna’, meaning facing hardships, is a necessary prerequisite here. In our ‘Vratas’ it is said that intake of food should be limited. Taking a dip in this state cleanses our body; only after this, the mind is cleansed. <br>Prayagraj is a confluence of 3 rivers. How peace is experienced at this place is given in the scriptures. It is a prerequisite for attainment of heaven. Yet, Peace is a must not just for the self; it is essential for the family, for the entire world. <br>By coming here, our hearts become wholesome, and we are absorbed in divinity. Furthermore, our lives are also raised to higher levels. It is this message that we get in the Mahakumbh.<br>Many have already gone there and experienced pure joy. Many more are watching Kumbh on their television sets. Many foreigners also, in addition to Indians, witness the Ganga Arati and get submerged in undiluted devotion. This takes all to a higher state of self-knowledge. <br>I believe that this is the greatness of Kumbh. <br>I am thankful to all those who have invited me here. Thank you all. Namaskar!&quot;</em></p>

                      <p><em>&quot;Before I begin I must thank the foundation. I am sharing my thoughts with you all. I have been Listening to the great scholars and their in-depth knowledge of sanskrit and the great knowledge of sanskrit overwhelmed me and I shall try and not do much of sanskrit. I will take up the theme of the journey that is Mahakumbh 2025. A Journey of Peace. We have got a very good explanation of what the mahakumbh is. And I am deeply honored to be there and listen to the great scholars because we have reached the point in the history of mankind where many of these in depth knowledge that the words carry has been buried and we are not able to dig out the real meanings of these words. One of the words that I came across is the word KUMBH which also means the womb of becoming. And so taking these thoughts a little further I would like to use Kumbh as a symbol of the Journey of Peace. Here I am using the word symbol in a rather technical sense, because a symbol does not point at itself. The symbol has the capacity of pointing to something beyond itself, it&#x27;s like a metaphor. Metaphor is a linguistic symbol and the word metaphor basically means to carry beyond. It&#x27;s a greek word from meta and phored. Phero means to carry and meta means beyond. It is a word in which we participate and which takes us beyond our present into a realm where we experience something far beyond. We are all pilgrims on our way to find something we cannot describe. Religion has used so many terms to tell us what really the ultimate goal of religion is, having taught religion for many many years I realized that we are only trying to console ourselves by nusing certain words when in reality we really don’t know where we are heading.This much we know<br>that this life is real and it is there for us to teach us many deep secrets of reality . So I am using the word SYMBOL which comes from the greek word Sym-together and Bolon – to throw<br>So two things are thrown together. We live in a world where we experience the physical realm but we also experience the invisible realm-realm we are not able to see – it is not a tangible world as such. So Kumbh stands as a symbol where these two realms meet and people come from all over the world to participate and here participation is a very important word because unless and until we participate in the symbol we shall not really experience what the symbol is trying to teach us. So what the symbol is really trying to teach us is togetherness. Now we have over 6000 years of human written history and we have reached a point where we are so very disintegrated we don’t trust each other. There is no sense of<br>relationship in us. We are disintegrated within and disintegrated without and that has disturbed our peace and we are searching for peace.<br>Take a person like Albert Camus. He said the world is so absurd. Here man wants to search for meaning and then when he questions the universe , the universe is silent. So this is how absurd the whole life is and then he goes further and he says this leads to depression, loss of meaning, nihilism and I think that’s where today’s world has reached and that we are not able to really find meaning. Then where do we look for. We look for the right villain- within and with others and that is a very important thing. So Kumbh stands as a symbol of togetherness.The journey of peace is not a single person’s journey- it is a journey of the entire humanity we are all journeying towards not any definite place as such but journeying around and it is not reaching a destination but is basically a manner of travelling. That needs to be<br>clearly understood. This is what really forms a community. This togetherness which Kumbh has clearly taught us imagine so many people ,millions coming there from all parts of the land and just to feel that oneness with each other not that they know each other but they are tied together by that invisible force and that invisible force is what am I am really talking about. That invisible force is the presence of the divine all come together in oneness and that is how we become a community and the word community basically means to come into unit and that’s what Kumbh stands for. I am not talking about it from the ancient point of view but from the present day problems we all face. It is an experience, and we have to<br>experience it. So Kumbh as a symbol leads us to that experience where we begin to understand oneness<br>and ultimately come into unity and once we experience that unity, and that’s when we experience the presence of the divine in our midst. The second part I want to talk about is Kumbh as celebration. Here, this is one thing that is very much<br>needed for human beings to celebrate. Why do we celebrate? A celebration is not just jumping around, celebration is a religious act-and that is what Kumbh stands for-a religious act. What are we really celebrating? Look at its history. After 144 years the 7 planets have aligned themselves. That speaks of<br>harmony of nature - as above so below. We are all trying to come together and that is what we are celebrating. It means that we are in harmony with nature and that is something we need badly in todays world,where man has dealt very badly with the earth and the earth today is now responding to</em></p>
                      <p><em>the bad treatment by us. Our earth is a living being and unfortunately we are looking at reality from a western perspective-man is the maker of all things, as Pythagoras said and we want to dominate the world that we live in. So we have made it into an object and we have become he master of that object. And today when the earth is responding to our treatment we don’t know what to do. Scientists say we<br>can save the earth. That is a wrong sloka. What we ought to do is serve the earth and that is something we deliberately have to do and this is what Kumbh stands for. That we come together in harmony for a greater purpose and our greater purpose is establishing a relationship with nature. If there is no inner peace there is no outer peace.There is no one without the other. This is one realization we all must come to. The earth is a living being. She needs to be treated with respect. The day we change our attitude to earth she will respond positively. We have to learn to look at our land from the eastern perspective and that will change everything.&quot;</em></p>

                      <p><em>&quot;Namaste to all.</em></p>
                      <p><em>I’m so happy and delighted to meet all the global scholars, peace aspirants, peace lovers, and students. My mentor, Prof. Girishkymar, asked me to explain the Mahakumbh experience. It was an amazing experience where we felt the true spirit of universal brotherhood during the sacred bath. You will definitely realize the oneness of the human family there. This is my experience to share.</em></p>
                      <p><em>I found peaceful faces everywhere. You get free food, free water, and prasad, and when you meet anyone there soldiers, forces, devotees, babas, or sadhus everyone just says “Pranam” to each other. We can see the true unity of our human family. I was blessed to have the opportunity to dip in Shahi. Thank you all.</em></p>
                      <p><em>The sacred bath in the sankh along with the babajees is beyond words to explain the spiritual feeling I had. This was the same experience shared with me by others about the sacred bath. The police officers, soldiers, and military people were all in a meditative mood with peace on their faces. There was grace on every face.</em></p>
                      <p><em>It is a fact that some supernatural power was working there, especially in organizing this big gathering the world’s largest spiritual gathering. I don’t know the science or logic behind it, but I share my true experience here.</em></p>
                      <p><em>I felt that Mother Earth was warning us to get united through the profound ideology of Vasudeva kudumbakam. I truly felt the unity, and many scholars who experienced the sacred bath said the same.</em></p>
                      <p><em>Only our Bharat can lead the world toward peace and harmony with its profound ideology of Vasudeva kudumbakam world is one family. That was my spirit in Prayagraj. Mahakumbh will be over by this Shivratri, but I know some of you could not come to experience Mahakumbh 2025. But our ArdhaKumbhs are coming and our holy Ganga is in the Himalayas. We at Amrithagiri are here to assist you. Please come to the Himalayas, participate in the beautiful Ganga Aarti, and feel the real spirituality and Ganga Snan. I invite you all, and our volunteers at Amrithagiri will support you.</em></p>
                      <p><em>I have gone through the publications and some speeches of our scholars who delivered speeches here in our webinar especially Prof. Priyankar Upadyaya, Prof. Sadashiv Dwivedi, Dr. Ravindra Muley, Dr. Sandeep Dhikale, Prof. Nishikant Borge, and Prof. Girishkumar R, University of Kerala. They explained how to integrate science and spirituality together, supporting each other in a complementary manner to lead the world toward peace. Only our Bharat can nurture the heart of science when its brain is nourished by the West. Yes, only Bharat can do it. Our ancient philosophy of Vedic science can do it. We are well equipped for that, and our nation is working on it. A science without that nourished heart will cause the self-destruction of the human race. That is the warning we are receiving from Mother Earth.</em></p>
                      <p><em>Like Covid, many signs have already been given to our world. All human beings have to unite and realize that we are all one human family, beyond the boundaries of religion, caste, geography, and even gender. We must have the spirit of universal brotherhood.</em></p>
                      <p><em>With that true spirit, I am sure we can find amicable solutions to national and international conflicts. Our senior citizens, our beloved children, and our upcoming youth must live peacefully and happily. They must live healthily and fearlessly on a planet without the fear of war a planet with love for them. It is the responsibility of our senior generation, and I am sure our scholars are working for it.</em></p>
                      <p><em>Let us all pray for a beautiful, peaceful world beyond all human-made boundaries. Let us unite together to make a peaceful world.</em></p>
                      <p><em>On behalf of Amrithagiri and associates, I express my gratefulness to all the scholars who delivered meaningful speeches here, and to our organizers the Eleven11 team, Vijayambika Madam, and all who worked hard as the pillars behind this webinar.</em></p>
                      <p><em>I invite your prayers and strong desires for a peaceful world. I strongly believe it will connect with the collective intelligence of the universe. I am sure a peaceful world is coming; our nation is working on it, and we should support our nation. That is the vision and mission of Amrithagiri. Let your self, your family, and your mind be filled with peace, and let it spread among our state, nation, and finally the world.</em></p>
                      <p><em>Namaste. Thank you.&quot;</em></p>
